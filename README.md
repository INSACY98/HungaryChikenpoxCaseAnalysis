MScA 31006 Time Series Analysis and Forecasting
### Executive Summary
The Chickenpox is an infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It causes an itchy rash with small, fluid-filled blisters. Chickenpox is highly contagious to people who haven't had the disease or been vaccinated against it. With the provided dataset for chickenpox cases from Hungary counties, it is possible to understand and assess chickenpox spread trending in those specific areas and even Hungary as a whole. By accurately predicting future cases, the local government can allocate medical resource and distribute vaccination more efficiently. 
### Getting Started
#### Work Approach
Different time series techniques were applied in this project including Box-Cox transformation & Difference for detrending and Seasonal Naive, Auto Arimas, Fourier ARIMA, TBATs, Linear Regression, ARFIMA, TSLM. Different models were compared with metrics MAPE and RMSE.  
The main challenges could be seen in slides.
